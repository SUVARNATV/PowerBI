-pizza sales should increase in the month of October by providing any offers.
-The ingredients of the pepperoni pizza should always be made readily available and in large quantities especially on Fridays as it is the most ordered pizza on the day.
-Since more orders are received on Fridays, a discount should be given to the customers on that day.
-More staff should be assigned to work on that day to avoid delays in orders.
-Offer discounted prices for the most ordered pizzas to encourage more customers to consider their favourite pizza.
